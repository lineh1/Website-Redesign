				<h2 style="text-align:center;">Important</h2>
				<p style="text-indent:40px;">These are the very special horses that will be with us for life. In most cases they have either undergone such abuse and neglect that they can never recover wholly from, are geriatrics or have some sort of disability which makes them unplaceable. Any horse that is available, that for whatever reason does not get adopted also has a home with us forever.It costs an average of $150.00 to feed a horse for one month. This only includes hay and grain. Add to that medical, farrier, dental, chiropractic, massage and training/exercise and it is practical to estimate $300.00+ a month expense, per horse. Please sponsor a horse today. For less than $1.00 per day, you can help these horses live out their days comfortably.</p>

				<h2 style="text-align:center;">Satin</h2>
				<p style="text-indent:40px;">Beautiful Satin was rescued from New Holland Auction in 3/10. She is another separation anxiety child, 29yrs old, 14hds and has a permanent home here with us. However, if the right person came along, she could be available.

				<h2 style="text-align:center;">Flower</h2>
				<p style="text-indent:40px;">Here is Flower (in front-Dana F), Persia (grey to the left) is her seeing eye dog. Persia is crippled from leg deformities. Behind flower is Stevie Wonder, also blind. Below is Stevie drinking with his seeing eye dog, another QH from the PA herd, Moonshine, who is late 20s or more and has few teeth left. Both pictures taken 6/14/17 in KY.

				<h2 style="text-align:center;">Grasshopper</h2>
				<p style="text-indent:40px;">Grasshopper is our resident "grandpa". He is as wide as he is tall. Standing at only about 10hds and being a very young 48 years old, he tells each horse his sad tale of his BFF Benji, who passed on. Every time he tells his story they let him have grain. Very entertaining to watch. This boy knows his job, babysitting our junior-junior riders, and does it extremely well.

				<h2 style="text-align:center;">Prince</h2>

				<h2 style="text-align:center;">Charlie (1979-2020)</h2>
				<p style="text-indent:40px;">Charlie Tuna was not a rescue, per se. When we moved our facility from Stillwater to Wantage, the owners of the Stillwater farm asked us to take him with us so he would not be alone. (We had planned to anyway). Charlie is a 15.2hd, 41 yr old TWH x Morgan gelding and totally blind from severe Cushings Syndrome. He does nothing but babysit Dahli and bring us joy. We had to teach him that it was okay for a gentleman to retire and still have dignity.

				<h2 style="text-align:center;">Will (1994-2019)</h2>
				<p style="text-indent:40px;">This handsome little TB was surrendered in the middle of a nor'easter. He has some emotional and physical scars, but he is the most personable and loving horse you will ever meet (and the most kissable roman nose!) At 25 yrs old, he is one of our endearing residents who loves attention.

				<p style="text-indent:40px;">Rosie is a lovely bay Polish Arabian rescued from Washington with Pru, Elle, Bekas, Prudenta, Sierra and Nega. She is semi-retired, but was our beginner lesson horse. At almost 28 years old she had a stroke. (Photos courtesy of Tobe Roberts 10/8/10)

He is by Procent out of Pandora (Aswan). He was the true founder of The Arabian Rescue Mission, started in 2003. He is loved and missed by Terry every day of every year
