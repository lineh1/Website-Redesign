			<h1>Adoptable Horses</h1>
			<p>The horses on this page are all available for adoption and housed here at our rescue, in KY, unless otherwise stated. They have come to us starved, abused, neglected, unwanted or have been surrendered by their owners for various reasons and are in varying degrees of rehabilitation. They have all fought hard to overcome health and emotional issues, so they must be placed with a suitable "forever" home. They may also be leased on-site as a trial run or until a suitable home is found.</p>
			<h1>How The Adoption Process Works</h1>
			<p>An adoption application must be completed and approved prior to being considered for one of these horses. Click here for an application, which can be emailed or mailed back to us after completion. You must come and meet the horse if you are local. If you decide this is the horse for you and the horse agrees, a $100.00 non-refundable deposit must be given. (Contrary to sales, adoptions do not go out on trial or leased off-property, unless prior petition has been made and approved by the Board). A placement agreement is then completed, signed and payment made. If a horse is registered, you will receive a copy of his/her registration papers. If you plan on showing, co-ownership is retained by the Rescue. Pick-up arrangements must be within 14 days of adoption. Longer stays may be arranged with board charges.</p>
			<p>ADOPTION FEES ARE NOT DONATIONS! THEY ARE NOT TAX DEDUCTIBLE.  However, your tax-deductible donation is greatly appreciated. Thank you!</p>
